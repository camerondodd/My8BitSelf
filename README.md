# My 8-Bit Self

## Summary </br>
If you have ever wondered how your every day life would translate into an old 8-bit RPG character, My 8-Bit Self is for you.  This application allows you to track your everyday habits in such a way that gives you experience.  As you level, your stats will reflect the actions you took to gain experience.  Pick your Avatar, change your Username and occupation under MyAccount, and don't forget to have fun!

From the homepage, users can login, or go to the info page to read more about the application.  If the user doesn't have an account, one will be created when they login with Google+. This take them to their profile page.

The profile page reflects the current state of the character(name, occupation, avatar, and stats).  From here they can go to MyAccount, which will allow them to change their username or occupation, as well as delete their account. Alternatively, from the profile page, the person can click "Change Avatar", to select a different avatar, which takes them back to the profile page, where their new picture will be waiting.

At any point in time the user can push the large "Log Adventure!"  button, which will take them to a page where they can log their daily habits from a preset list.  Whenever the user selects one, they are notified that their experience has increased and are given the option to log another adventure or return to their character page.

When ten adventures are logged, their level will increase, and the user's stats will increase based on the activities they completed.  If someone only logs weight training, they will have a high strength statistic, but everything else will still be one.  In this way, the character should reflect the habits of the person recording them, assuming they are honest in their habit tracking.
